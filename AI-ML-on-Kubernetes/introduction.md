## üîß Common Tools for AI/ML on Kubernetes

### 1. Kubeflow
- **Purpose:** End-to-end ML platform (training, serving, pipelines, hyperparameter tuning).  
- **Pros:** Full ecosystem, scalable, supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc.  
- **Cons:** Complex setup, heavy for small teams.  

### 2. Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)
- **Purpose:** Workflow orchestration for ML pipelines.  
- **Pros:** Reproducibility, pipeline visualization, experiment tracking.  
- **Cons:** Steep learning curve, tied to Kubeflow ecosystem.  

### 3. MLflow on Kubernetes
- **Purpose:** Experiment tracking, model registry, and serving.  
- **Pros:** Lightweight, integrates well with ML stacks.  
- **Cons:** Lacks orchestration features, needs extra scaling work.  

### 4. Ray on Kubernetes
- **Purpose:** Distributed training & hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Pros:** Easy scaling of Python ML workloads, good for reinforcement learning.  
- **Cons:** Still maturing, cluster tuning required.  

### 5. Argo Workflows
- **Purpose:** General workflow orchestration (used for ML pipelines).  
- **Pros:** Cloud-native, lightweight alternative to Kubeflow Pipelines.  
- **Cons:** Lacks ML-specific features out of the box.  

### 6. NVIDIA GPU Operator
- **Purpose:** Manages GPU drivers, monitoring, and scheduling.  
- **Pros:** Simplifies GPU provisioning, enables GPU sharing.  
- **Cons:** Vendor-specific (NVIDIA only).  

### 7. Seldon Core / KServe
- **Purpose:** Model serving & deployment.  
- **Pros:** Supports multiple runtimes (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, custom).  
- **Cons:** Additional setup and monitoring complexity.
