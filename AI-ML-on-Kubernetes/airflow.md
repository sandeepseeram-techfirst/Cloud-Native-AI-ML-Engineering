# Apache Airflow 

**Apache Airflow** is a versatile workflow orchestration tool designed to efficiently manage and automate complex data pipelines. Although not specifically designed for AI/ML, it is highly adaptable and can orchestrate various tasks, including ML pipelines. Airflow’s strengths lie in its flexibility and extensibility—it supports a broad ecosystem of operators and plugins.
 
While it can manage Kubernetes workloads, it lacks the deep integration with Kubernetes and specialized AI/ML tools that Kubeflow provides, making it more suited for heterogeneous environments where AI is part of broader data processing tasks.
