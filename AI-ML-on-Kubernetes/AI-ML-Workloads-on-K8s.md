# AI/ML Workloads on Kubernetes 

Kubernetes provides essential scalability for AI workloads, allowing horizontal scaling across multiple nodes. Its flexibility supports hybrid and multi-cloud environments, making managing AI models that require extensive computational resources easier. 

Kubernetes also excels at handling batch processing, speeding up AI model training by executing tasks in parallel.

## Use Case - OpenAI 

**OpenAI**, uses Kubernetes to manage its extensive AI research workloads across cloud and on-premises environments. By leveraging Kubernetes for batch scheduling and dynamic scaling, OpenAI has significantly reduced the time required to launch experiments, scaling up to hundreds of GPUs within weeks—a process that previously took months. 

This flexibility allows OpenAI to optimize costs and access specialized hardware, demonstrating Kubernetes’ effectiveness in handling demanding AI workloads.
