# Agentic AI Foundations 

# Agentic AI: A Simplified Overview

## What is Agency?
- **Agency** = ability to take action to achieve desired outcomes.  
- Requires **planning, action, memory, and reflection**.  
- These capabilities form the foundation of modern AI agents.  

## Evolution of AI Agents
- **Traditional AI Agents**:  
  - Designed for specific, well-defined tasks.  
  - Worked like assistants following instructions.  

- **Modern AI Agents**:  
  - Aim to achieve broader **goals**, not just tasks.  
  - Can handle **unstructured and novel data** (e.g., sensory inputs).  
  - Transform ambiguous info into **actionable insights**.  
  - Act as **problem solvers**: planning, reasoning, adapting, executing.  

## What is Agentic AI?
- Also known as **multi-agent AI** or **autonomous AI**.  
- AI systems that **decide and act independently** toward complex goals.  
- Key traits:  
  - **Adaptability** â€“ respond to new situations in real time.  
  - **Interoperability** â€“ collaborate with other agents.  
  - **Continuous learning** â€“ refine decisions over time.  

## Impact
- Moves beyond Generative AI (GenAI) â†’ enables **autonomous workflows**.  
- According to GartnerÂ®:  
  - By **2028**, 33% of enterprise software will include Agentic AI (up from <1% in 2024).  
  - **15% of daily work decisions** will be made autonomously.

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** Agentic AI is the next stage of AI evolutionâ€”autonomous, adaptable, and goal-driven systems that move from being assistants to becoming decision-makers and executors.
