# What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to operate as autonomous agents — meaning they can perceive, reason, decide, and act in pursuit of goals with minimal or no human intervention.

Instead of just producing a one-off response (like ChatGPT answering a single question), agentic AI:

1. Takes a goal as input (e.g., “Find and summarize the top three competitors in the electric vehicle market”).

2. Plans a sequence of actions to achieve that goal.

3. Executes actions, which can involve calling APIs, searching the web, running code, or interacting with other agents.

4. Observes results and adapts its next actions accordingly.

5. Stops when the goal is achieved or a stopping condition is met.

** Essentially, it’s AI that can think, plan, and act in a loop — not just chat. **
