# Cloud-Native Databases: Overview, Working, and Use Cases

## 1. What Are Cloud-Native Databases?
A **cloud-native database** is a database that’s **built and optimized specifically for cloud environments** — meaning it is designed from the ground up to leverage **cloud-native principles** like:

- **Elastic scalability** – seamlessly scale up/down as demand changes.
- **Distributed architecture** – data is stored across multiple nodes/regions for resilience and performance.
- **API-driven provisioning** – fully managed and provisioned via automation.
- **Self-healing & fault-tolerance** – node failures don’t cause downtime.
- **Multi-tenancy** – serve multiple workloads/clients securely from the same cluster.
- **Integration with cloud-native ecosystems** – works well with Kubernetes, containers, service meshes, CI/CD, etc.

They differ from “traditional” databases that are **lifted and shifted** to the cloud (like running Oracle or SQL Server on a VM). Cloud-native databases **aren’t just hosted in the cloud — they’re architected for it**.
