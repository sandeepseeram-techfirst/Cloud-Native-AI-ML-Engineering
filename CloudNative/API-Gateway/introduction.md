# API Gateway â€” Deep Dive

## 1. What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a **server layer** that acts as an **entry point** for client requests to access one or more backend services (usually in microservices architectures).

Think of it as:

> The **traffic controller** and **security guard** for all incoming API calls.

Instead of clients calling backend services directly, **all traffic goes through the API Gateway**, which then routes, processes, and manages requests.
