# Machine Learning

ML is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms and statistical models enabling systems to learn from data. 
Goal: To make predictions or decisions based on past data.
Scope: Includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, etc.

Machine Learning, an aspect of Artificial Intelligence where we train models to classify, label, answer, and create. 
Models, along with their predictions, are the end product of the machine learning process, but ML begins with the techniques and algorithms used to prepare and process data.

Training a model involves feeding data through these algorithms and adjusting parameters. This process often relies on brute force and trial-and-error methods before arriving at a model that is sufficiently accurate.


**Supervised Learning**: Data is labeled, and the program learns to predict the output from the input data
**Unsupervised Learning**: Data is unlabeled, and the program learns to recognize the inherent structure in the input data
