# Machine Learning Engineer 

The decision-making systems in our world are increasingly reliant on algorithmic thinking. Machine learning engineering is key to implementing these algorithms and automating the prediction process.

### What is Machine Learning? 

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that allows systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions **without being explicitly programmed**.  

## Key Components
- **Mathematics**: Probability, Linear Algebra, and Calculus form the foundation of models.  
- **Computer Science**: Programming languages implement these models into executable tasks.  
- **Statistics**: Ensures models reflect data accurately and helps evaluate their performance.
