# Feature Engineering 

**Feature engineering** is an integral part of building and implementing machine learning models.

## Whats a Feature? 
A feature is a measurable property in a dataset, and a feature can be used as an input to a machine learning model. One way to think about features is as predictor variables that go into a model to predict the outcome variable. 

**For example,** if we want a model that predicts precipitation at a given place and time, we might use temperature, humidity, month, altitude, etc. as inputs. These are our features.
